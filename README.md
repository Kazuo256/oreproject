# ORE Project

ORE (a recursive acronym for "ORE is Regrettably Excursive") is a minimalist
bundler for Lua rocks. It makes LuaRocks install them into a project's local
folder tree, and sets up your environment so that Lua applications become aware
of the those installed rocks. It works only with bash.
